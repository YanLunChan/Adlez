## üéØ Project Overview

*   Engine: Unity
*   Language: C#
*   Genre: 2D Top-Down Bullet Hell, Action
*   Project Type: Solo Development
*   Focus: Gameplay Programming, Systems Architecture, Performance, Polish

## ‚ú® Features

*   Responsive Character Control: Smooth movement, dashing, and combo-based attack mechanics.
*   Weapon Progression System: Unlock and upgrade 4 distinct weapons that fundamentally change gameplay strategy.
*   Challenging Boss Fights: A final boss with multiple phases and complex attack patterns.
*   Dynamic Mini-Map: Provides essential spatial awareness during intense combat.
*   Optimized Performance: Maintains a stable framerate even with 100+ entities on screen.

### Key Contributions:

*   Character Systems: Architected and coded the player's core movement (running, dashing, physics-based jumping) and combo-based attack system from the ground up in C#, ensuring a responsive and satisfying feel.
*   Weapon & Progression Systems: Designed and implemented 3 out of the 4 core weapon upgrades using ScriptableObjects and a modular code architecture. Each upgrade meaningfully alters combat flow and player strategy.
*   Boss & Level Design: Built the final boss encounter using a Finite State Machine (FSM) to orchestrate complex attack patterns and phase transitions. Constructed the final level's layout, enemy placement, and environmental challenges.
*   UI & Systems: Developed a dynamic mini-map system and HUD to display critical player information clearly.
*   Game Feel & Polish: Passionately tuned hitbox accuracy through frame-by-frame analysis and implemented robust feedback loops (screen shake, sound effects, particle systems) to make combat feel impactful and visceral.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Implementation

*   Architecture: Component-based design in C# for modular and reusable systems.
*   Performance: Utilized object pooling and optimized algorithms to maintain a stable 60 FPS during intense combat.
*   Tools: Unity Editor, Visual Studio.
*   Version Control: Unity Collaborate.
